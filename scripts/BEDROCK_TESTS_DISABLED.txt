🚨 CRITICAL - ALL BEDROCK TEST SCRIPTS DISABLED

Date: 2026-02-19
Reason: Repeated Marketplace subscription triggers

AFFECTED SCRIPTS (DO NOT RUN):
- test-aws-services.py
- detailed-bedrock-test.py  
- monitor-bedrock-access.py
- resolve-bedrock-payment.py
- comprehensive-test-suite.py
- generate-embeddings.py

ISSUE:
Each invocation of bedrock.invoke_model() triggers AWS Marketplace 
subscription validation, which creates agreement emails.

We ran these scripts 5+ times in the last hour, causing repeated 
subscription attempts.

ACTION TAKEN:
1. All test scripts flagged as DISABLED
2. No further Bedrock invocations until issue resolved
3. Audit complete - no automated loops found
4. No production code is running (no Lambda invocations)

NEXT STEPS:
1. Wait for AWS Marketplace to stabilize (24 hours)
2. Contact AWS Support about repeated subscription triggers
3. Do NOT run any Bedrock tests
4. System will use mock analysis until cleared by AWS

SAFE TO RUN:
- Transcribe tests (no Marketplace involvement)
- DynamoDB operations
- S3 operations
- Frontend deployment

DO NOT RUN UNTIL CLEARED:
- Any script with "bedrock" in the name
- Any script that calls invoke_model()
- test-aws-services.py (includes Bedrock tests)
