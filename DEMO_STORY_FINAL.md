### 🎯 JANUARY 2026: Team Discovers MeetingMind

The team uploads their 3 failed meetings to MeetingMind and sees:
- **Graveyard:** 20 abandoned tasks with epitaphs
- **Chronic Blocker:** "Fix auth bug" appeared twice, never resolved

### Meeting 4: "Should We Pivot" (Feb 2, 2026)
**Grade: 95 (A) | Completion: 1/1 (100%)**

**Story:** BREAKTHROUGH! After seeing their graveyard, the team had a focused strategic pivot discussion.

**Action Items:**
- ✅ Discuss target user, core feature, and business model in group chat (Zeeshan) - DONE

**Summary:** "The team discovered MeetingMind and uploaded their previous failed meetings. Seeing the graveyard of 20 abandoned tasks and the chronic auth bug pattern was eye-opening. They had a focused strategic discussion about pivoting: should they target designers or developers? Build mobile or responsive web? What pricing model? They decided to focus on developers first, build a responsive website, and use freemium pricing. This clarity was transformative."

**Decisions:**
1. Focus on developers first (not designers)
2. Build responsive website (not mobile app)
3. Use freemium pricing model
4. Fix the auth bug before any new features

**Key Insight:** Perfect execution. Single focused task, 100% completion.

- ✅ Check email notifications in production (Ayush) - DONE
- ✅ Set up load testing (Ayush) - DONE
- ❌ Redesign profile page (Alishba) - Low priority, acceptable

**Summary:** "Strong progress this week! Ayush FINALLY fixed the auth bug that had been blocking us for months. The job browse page is complete, email notifications are working, and load testing is set up. Only the profile page redesign remains incomplete, but it's low priority. Team morale is high. The focused approach from our pivot meeting is paying off."

**Key Insight:** Sustained momentum. 80% completion rate.
