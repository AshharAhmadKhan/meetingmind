**"Good morning team, this is our Sprint Planning meeting for Risk Score Testing.**

**Let's go through our action items for this sprint.**

**First action item: Update the API documentation. Ashhar, can you handle that by Friday? Great.**

**Second: We need someone to review the infrastructure costs and prepare a summary report. This one doesn't have an owner yet, so let's discuss who can take this.**

**Third item: Priya, please send the updated project timeline to all stakeholders by Wednesday.**

**Fourth: Set up the new contractor onboarding workflow. We don't have a specific deadline for this yet, but it's important to get done soon.**

**And finally: Book a team workshop for next month's planning session. No owner assigned yet on this one.**

**Alright, those are our five action items. Let's make sure we follow through. Meeting adjourned, thank you everyone."**
