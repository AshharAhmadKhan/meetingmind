# SCRIPT 1: "We Need To Actually Ship This"
Upload first. Backdate 3 days.

---

Alright, this is our demo prep sync. We have seven days before we present to the entrepreneurship cell. Seven days. Where are we at?

*pause*

Backend is mostly done. Job posting API works, user profiles work. Payment integration is taking longer than I thought though.

*pause*

How much longer?

*pause*

Maybe three more days? Stripe's documentation is confusing.

*pause*

Wait, three days? We need payments working for the demo.

*pause*

I know. Ayush will have it done by Wednesday night.

*pause*

Yeah. Wednesday night.

*pause*

Okay. How's the frontend looking?

*pause*

Desktop version is clean. Mobile is completely broken though. The job cards don't even render properly on my phone.

*pause*

Can Alishba fix mobile?

*pause*

I think it's a backend issue. The API responses are formatted weird. I messaged Ayush about this three days ago.

*pause*

Oh shit, I didn't see that. My bad. What's the issue?

*pause*

The job data comes back as a string instead of an object sometimes. Breaks the whole UI.

*pause*

Okay, Ayush will look at it tonight.

*pause*

Tonight? Dude, we need this fixed now.

*pause*

I know! Ayush is doing payments and now this. Ayush will get to both.

*pause*

Alright. So mobile needs to be fixed before Friday. Alishba will fix the CSS part if Ayush fixes the API part, right?

*pause*

Yeah, Alishba can do that.

*pause*

Okay. So Ayush fixes API response format by Friday. Alishba fixes mobile CSS by Friday.

*pause*

What about the landing page? We can't show them the current one.

*pause*

What's wrong with it?

*pause*

It looks like a template. We need custom graphics, better copy, actual screenshots.

*pause*

Okay so we need to redesign the landing page. Who's doing that?

*pause*

Alishba can do the design but someone needs to write the copy.

*pause*

Ashhar will write the copy. When do you need it?

*pause*

Like tomorrow if Alishba is going to have the page done by Friday.

*pause*

Okay. Ashhar will send copy by tomorrow evening.

*pause*

What about user testing? Didn't we say we'd test with real students?

*pause*

Yeah. We should get like five people to try it and give feedback.

*pause*

When though? We're running out of time.

*pause*

This weekend? Saturday and Sunday?

*pause*

That's cutting it really close. The presentation is Monday.

*pause*

I know but we need the feedback. Someone should recruit testers and schedule sessions.

*pause*

Ayush can ask people in his CS class. Ayush will recruit five testers by Thursday.

*pause*

What are we cutting? We can't build everything in seven days.

*pause*

Good point. We need to decide.

*pause*

Okay, decisions: we're cutting the messaging feature. Not ready, not showing it.

*pause*

Agreed. That was going to take another week anyway.

*pause*

And we're cutting the rating system. We'll add it later.

*pause*

Yeah, ratings aren't critical for the demo.

*pause*

Alright. So to summarize: Ayush finishes payment integration by Wednesday. Ayush fixes API response format by Friday. Alishba fixes mobile CSS by Friday. Ashhar writes landing page copy by tomorrow evening. Alishba redesigns landing page by Friday. Ayush recruits five testers by Thursday. Everyone updates the group chat by tomorrow night with progress.

*pause*

This is intense.

*pause*

Yeah. But we're actually going to finish this time, right?

*pause*

Yes. We're finishing this. No matter what.

# SCRIPT 2: "Quick Sync — How's Everything Going"
Upload second. Backdate 10 days.

---

Hey guys, quick weekly check-in. What did everyone get done this week?

*pause*

Ashhar finished the job posting form. It's live. You can create a job, set the price, add a description, all that.

*pause*

Nice, I tested it yesterday. Looks good.

*pause*

Ayush got the database schema finalized and deployed. And Ayush fixed that bug where the homepage was loading super slow.

*pause*

Oh thank god, that was annoying.

*pause*

What about the auth bug? The one where people get logged out randomly?

*pause*

Uh... still there.

*pause*

Didn't we talk about this last week?

*pause*

Yeah. And the week before. I know.

*pause*

Dude, it's been like two weeks.

*pause*

I know! Every time Ayush starts looking at it, something else breaks and Ayush has to fix that first.

*pause*

At this point the auth bug IS the thing that's breaking. Users keep complaining.

*pause*

Ayush will do it this week. For real this time. Ayush will have the auth bug fixed by Friday.

*pause*

Can we actually commit to that?

*pause*

Yes. Friday. Top of Ayush's list.

*pause*

Holding you to that.

*pause*

What about the profile page? That was supposed to be done last week.

*pause*

Alishba didn't get to it. Alishba got pulled into fixing the navigation menu.

*pause*

So profiles still aren't working?

*pause*

They work, they're just ugly. Alishba needs to redesign them.

*pause*

When can Alishba do that?

*pause*

This week. Alishba will have the profile page redesigned by Wednesday.

*pause*

What about the email notifications? Are those working yet?

*pause*

They send from my test account. I don't know if they work in production.

*pause*

Ayush will check that.

*pause*

And Alishba started working on the job browse page but it's not done yet.

*pause*

When will that be ready?

*pause*

Maybe end of this week? It's a lot of filtering logic.

*pause*

Okay. Anything else?

*pause*

We should probably do some load testing. Make sure the site doesn't crash when multiple people use it.

*pause*

Good idea. Can Ayush set that up?

*pause*

Yeah, Ayush will do it next week.

*pause*

Cool. So this week: Ayush fixes the auth bug by Friday. Alishba redesigns profile page by Wednesday. Alishba finishes job browse page by end of week. Ayush checks email notifications in production.

*pause*

And please actually fix the auth bug this time.

*pause*

Ayush will! Ayush promises. Third time's the charm, right?

*pause*

*laughs* It better be.

*pause*

Alright. Same time next week?

*pause*

Yep. See you guys.

# SCRIPT 3: "Should We Pivot?"
Upload third. Backdate 19 days.

---

Okay so I've been thinking... maybe we need to rethink our approach here.

*pause*

What do you mean?

*pause*

Like, who are we actually building this for? Designers or developers?

*pause*

I thought we said both?

*pause*

Yeah but maybe we should focus on one first. Like start with designers, get traction, then add developers later.

*pause*

Or we could do developers first. There's more of them.

*pause*

But designers pay more for freelance work.

*pause*

True. But developers are easier to reach. We're all in CS.

*pause*

What if we did both but had separate sections? Like "Design Jobs" and "Dev Jobs"?

*pause*

That could work. Or it could be confusing.

*pause*

Yeah, I don't know.

*pause*

What about mobile? Should we build a mobile app or just make the website responsive?

*pause*

Mobile app is a lot of work.

*pause*

But everyone uses their phone for everything now.

*pause*

We could do mobile web first, then native app later if it takes off.

*pause*

That makes sense. Maybe.

*pause*

What about pricing? Should we charge from day one or grow free users first?

*pause*

I feel like we should charge. Otherwise how do we make money?

*pause*

But if we charge, we might not get users.

*pause*

We could do freemium. Like free to browse, paid to apply.

*pause*

Or free for students, paid for professionals.

*pause*

That's interesting.

*pause*

Yeah. Or we could take a commission on each job.

*pause*

Like Upwork?

*pause*

Exactly.

*pause*

But then we need payment processing, which is complicated.

*pause*

We need that anyway though.

*pause*

True.

*pause*

So what are we actually deciding here?

*pause*

I don't know. I just feel like we need to be more focused.

*pause*

Focused on what though?

*pause*

Like... our target user. Our core feature. Our business model.

*pause*

Didn't we figure this out last time?

*pause*

We talked about it. I don't think we decided anything.

*pause*

So what are we actually doing differently from last time?

*pause*

Uh... good question.

*pause*

We're being more organized?

*pause*

Are we though?

*pause*

I mean, we're having meetings.

*pause*

We had meetings last time too.

*pause*

Yeah.

*pause*

So... what should we do?

*pause*

Maybe we should each think about this more and discuss in the group chat?

*pause*

Yeah, okay. Let's do that.

*pause*

Should we meet again this week or wait until next week?

*pause*

Let's see how the group chat discussion goes.

*pause*

Okay. So we'll discuss more in the chat and figure out our direction.

*pause*

Sounds good.

*pause*

Alright.

# SCRIPT 4: "Last Week Of The Project"
Upload fourth. Then run: python scripts/backdate-meeting.py <MEETING_ID> 52

---

Okay guys, this is it. This is the week we actually finish everything and launch.

*pause*

I'm so ready. Alishba has been working on this landing page all week.

*pause*

Same. The backend is like 90% done.

*pause*

Okay so let's go through everything. What does Ayush need to finish?

*pause*

Ayush needs to finish the API endpoints for job applications. Should take this weekend. Ayush will have it done by Sunday night.

*pause*

Perfect.

*pause*

What about the database? Is that fully set up?

*pause*

Yeah, database is done. Ayush just needs to add one more table for the messaging feature. Ayush will add that by Monday.

*pause*

Alishba is going to complete the landing page this weekend. New hero section, screenshots, testimonials, the whole thing. Alishba will have it done by Sunday.

*pause*

Amazing.

*pause*

What about the logo? Do we have a final logo?

*pause*

Alishba has three options. We need to pick one.

*pause*

Let's pick one right now. Show us.

*pause*

Alishba will send them in the chat after this. We can vote.

*pause*

Okay. So Ashhar will pick the final logo by tomorrow after everyone votes.

*pause*

What is Ashhar doing?

*pause*

Ashhar is doing all the outreach. Ashhar is going to email 20 college entrepreneurship clubs this week and get them to share our launch. Ashhar will have all 20 emails sent by Wednesday.

*pause*

Twenty? That's a lot.

*pause*

We need users. Ashhar will send personalized emails to each one.

*pause*

What about the pricing page? We need to explain how payments work.

*pause*

Ashhar will write that too. Ashhar will have the pricing page copy done by Tuesday.

*pause*

And Alishba will design it by Wednesday.

*pause*

Should we do a beta test? Like get a few people to try it before we fully launch?

*pause*

Yes. Good idea. We need to create a signup form for beta testers.

*pause*

Alishba can build that. Just a simple form that collects emails. Alishba will have the beta signup form done by Monday.

*pause*

And we should test everything end-to-end. Like actually go through the whole flow as a user.

*pause*

Definitely. Let's all do that this weekend. Ashhar will coordinate the full user flow testing by Sunday and make sure everyone completes it.

*pause*

This is exciting. We're actually going to launch.

*pause*

We are. This is happening.

*pause*

When's launch day?

*pause*

Next Friday. One week from today.

*pause*

That's so soon.

*pause*

We're ready. We've been working on this for weeks.

*pause*

Alright. Let's finish strong.

*pause*

Let's do it.

# SCRIPT 5: "Okay Let's Actually Do This"
Upload fifth. Then run: python scripts/backdate-meeting.py <MEETING_ID> 68

---

Okay guys, this is it. We're actually doing this. We're building a student marketplace.

*pause*

I'm so excited. This is going to be huge.

*pause*

So what's the plan? What are we building?

*pause*

Everything. We're building the full platform.

*pause*

Okay but like, specifically what features?

*pause*

Job postings, user profiles, messaging, payments, reviews, analytics, the whole thing.

*pause*

That's... a lot.

*pause*

We can do it. We're all smart. We'll just work hard.

*pause*

How long do we have?

*pause*

Ashhar is thinking we launch in six weeks.

*pause*

Six weeks?! For a full marketplace?

*pause*

Yeah. If we really commit, we can do it.

*pause*

Okay. I'm in. What do you need from Alishba?

*pause*

Design. All of it. Every screen, every component, every interaction.

*pause*

How many screens are we talking?

*pause*

I don't know, like fifteen? Homepage, login, signup, dashboard, job posting, job browsing, profile, messaging, payments, settings...

*pause*

Fifteen screens in six weeks?

*pause*

Alishba can do it. Alishba is fast.

*pause*

Okay. Alishba will have all the designs done by next weekend.

*pause*

Next weekend? That's insane. I love it.

*pause*

What about Ayush? What is Ayush building?

*pause*

The entire backend. Database, API, authentication, everything.

*pause*

The entire backend in six weeks?

*pause*

Ayush built that class project in two weeks. This is the same thing, just bigger.

*pause*

That class project was like three tables and five endpoints.

*pause*

So this is like ten tables and twenty endpoints. Ayush has got this.

*pause*

Alright. Ayush will have the complete backend done in two weeks.

*pause*

Two weeks! Yes! That's the energy!

*pause*

What is Ashhar doing?

*pause*

Ashhar is doing marketing and user acquisition. Ashhar is going to get us 50 beta users before we even launch.

*pause*

Fifty users? How?

*pause*

Ashhar will post in every college Facebook group, every Discord server, every Slack workspace. Ashhar will email professors. Ashhar will talk to student clubs. Ashhar will get 50 signups by the end of next week.

*pause*

When is Ashhar doing all this?

*pause*

Starting tomorrow.

*pause*

That's ambitious.

*pause*

We have to be ambitious. This is a startup.

*pause*

Are we actually starting a company? Like registering it and everything?

*pause*

Yes. Ashhar will handle all the legal stuff. Ashhar will register the company by next Wednesday.

*pause*

What about funding? Do we need money?

*pause*

Eventually. But first we build the product, get users, then we raise money.

*pause*

Should we write an investor pitch?

*pause*

Yes! Great idea. Ashhar will write a full investor pitch deck by next Friday.

*pause*

This is a lot to do in one week.

*pause*

We can do it. We're going to work every day. No breaks.

*pause*

What about classes?

*pause*

Classes are secondary. This is our future.

*pause*

My parents are going to kill me if I fail my classes.

*pause*

You're not going to fail. You're just going to work really hard on this too.

*pause*

Should we create social media accounts?

*pause*

Yes! Instagram, Twitter, LinkedIn, everything. Ashhar will create all the accounts and start posting by Monday.

*pause*

What is Ashhar going to post?

*pause*

Behind the scenes stuff. "We're building something cool." Teasers. Get people excited.

*pause*

We should have a website too. Like a landing page that explains what we're building.

*pause*

Ashhar will build that this weekend. Just one page with an email signup form.

*pause*

This weekend? That's like two days.

*pause*

It's one page. Ashhar can knock it out in a few hours.

*pause*

Okay so let me make sure I have this right. Alishba designs all fifteen screens by next weekend. Ayush builds the complete backend in two weeks. Ashhar gets 50 beta signups by next week, Ashhar registers the company by Wednesday, Ashhar writes an investor pitch by Friday, Ashhar creates all social media accounts by Monday, and Ashhar builds a landing page this weekend.

*pause*

Exactly.

*pause*

This is insane.

*pause*

This is what it takes to build something real.

*pause*

Alright. I'm in.

*pause*

Me too.

*pause*

This is going to be the thing we're proud of. Five years from now, we're going to look back and say this is where it started.

*pause*

Let's do it.

*pause*

Let's build something amazing.

*pause*

Let's actually do this.
